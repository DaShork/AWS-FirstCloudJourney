### [Blog 1 - Integrate tokenization with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails for secure data handling](3.1-Blog1/)

The blog demonstrates how to integrate Amazon Bedrock Guardrails with third-party tokenization services to secure Personally Identifiable Information within generative AI workflows. While Guardrails can only mask PII with generic placeholders, this integrated approach replaces those masks with format-preserving and reversible tokens. This architecture, orchestrated using AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda, allows downstream systems to operate on cryptographically protected yet structurally valid data, thereby maintaining both the security and the functional utility of the data throughout the entire processing pipeline.

### [Blog 2 - Running deep research AI agents on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](3.2-Blog2/)

The blog introduces the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime as a secure, serverless platform designed to deploy advanced AI Agents (such as LangGraph-based Deep Agents with multi-agent collaboration and complex reasoning capabilities) into production environments at scale. AgentCore tackles the infrastructure management challenge by providing a fully isolated environment for each session, while flexibly supporting any agent framework and LLM model. Using the AgentCore Starter Toolkit, developers can deploy complex systems with minimal code changes, allowing them them to focus on agent logic instead of worrying about enterprise-grade security, scalability, and features like persistent memory.
